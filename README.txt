When you run this program you will be prompted in the console for the input file, the maximum number of elements, and the number of children a node should have (k).
Enter the file path, the maximum number of elements, and k. The program will then generate a file named output.txt
If the file does not exist rerun the program and enter a file path of an input file that exists.

Thank you,
